- Hometown: Westport, CT
- Hobbies: Watching/Playing Sports, Working Out, Listening to Music, Biking/Running/Hiking in Nature
- First Computer I Ever Saw: Because I was born to two working parents living in the city in 2005, the first computer I ever saw was probably a later version of the Apple PowerBook.
- About me: I was born in Manhattan in New York City but moved to a suburb in Connecticut when I was 4, and lived there full time before last year when I began at UVA. For almost all of my life I've had a great passion for sports, as I played baseball from pre-k to senior year of high school and spent time playing other sports over the years as well, especially soccer. I do some intramural sports here at UVA now but nothing serious. I can't get enough of my three favorite sports teams, the Mets, Jets and Knicks, as I'm constantly annoying my younger brother Donovan (junior in high school) and younger sister Dani (freshman in high school) by talking about them or watching them back home. I'm big into exercise as I try to get to the gym every day to run or lift weights, and I love searching for music to listen to while I'm at the gym (or not at the gym). I have two loving parents and a mini golden doodle named Tucker (who's 6 years old), and my favorite color is orange (just like my hair).
