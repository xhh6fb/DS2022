- Hometown: Arlington, VA
- Hobbies: baking, reading, swimming
- First Computer I Ever Saw: My family desktop, which I was not allowed to touch for many years without supervision. I believe it was a Dell Dimension 2400.  
- About me: I am a cat person and have two cats at home named Arnold and Palmer. My favorite time of year in Cville is fall and spring becuase once my allergies stop killing me, I love to be outside in the nice weather.
