# I'm Maya Uwaydat, and welcome to my corner of the Internet. 
## Well...a corner where I'm not entirely anonymous. 

- Hometown: Little Rock, Arkansas
- Hobbies: Writing, making electronic music, drawing, some video games here and there, researching topics I like
- First Computer I Ever Saw: The first computer I ever remember seeing wasd this massive DELL desktop my father had with this big monitor. I think the beginnings of my fascination with technology began with this computer, as I'd spend lots of time on Microsoft Office programs trying to mess with them as much as possible in addition to just trying to hyper-customize fonts and such in general. The oldest computer I've ever interacted with in person was my mom's old Windows XP she had used for work; I was very fond of Clippy and honestly still am. 
- About me: I dunno. Where do I start with a question like this?
