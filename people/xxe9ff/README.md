- Hometown: Mclean VA
- Hobbies: Soccer, Coding, History, Pickleball, F1
- First Computer I Ever Saw: 2004 Dell PC -- it was my grandfathers computer that was not very powerful
- About me: I'm a very big Liverpool fan and hate Chelsea (everyone hates Chelsea). I'm part of club 128 (Fiji) and like going out on weekends. This summer I started playing pickleball and really enjoy it now. I also built a PC this summer and now I use it for coding, simulations, and as a server from time to time (as well as gaming). I used to be a big history buff but have moved a bit out of that phase and now like to keep up with global affairs.
