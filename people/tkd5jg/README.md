- Hobbies: baking, swimming, reading
- First Computer I Ever Saw: I remember my parents had a 2000s Windows desktop in their bedroom and I would go draw for hours using Microsoft Paint.
- About me: I am so excited to be a part of the first BSDS cohort! I definitely still have a lot to learn, but I am eager to see where I will be at the end of these three years!
