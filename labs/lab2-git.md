# Lab 2: GitHub Skills

Follow all the steps below for practice using Git and GitHub. 

## 1. Practice With GitHub Skills (Web Browser)

1. Go to **GitHub Skills** https://skills.github.com/
2. Find the first lesson, "Introduction to GitHub" and right-click on the link to open it in a new browser tab.
3. Read the page closely, paying attention to what you will do in this lesson.
4. Right-click on the "Start course" button to open it in a new brower tab.
5. Follow the instructions closely to copy their lesson into your own account.
6. Once that is complete, wait about 20 seconds and refresh the page in your copy of the lesson.
7. Follow the instructions to complete the lesson.
8. Once complete, go back to https://skills.github.com/ and complete the "Review pull requests" lesson using the same steps as above.

## 2. Fork a Repository and Submit a Pull Request (Command-Line)

1. Go to https://github.com/uvasds-systems/DS2022/ and fork the repository.
2. Clone your fork to your local computer, or open in a Codespace.
3. Within the `people` directory create a subdirectory named with your computing ID, i.e. `nem2p` or `mst3k`, etc.
4. Inside of that subdirectory, create a README.md file.
5. Paste the code below into that file, and fill out the appropriate fields. If you'd like to include an image of yourself (jpg, png, gif, etc.) add it to your subdirectory as well. Introduce yourselves! If you need an example for reference, see [this page](../people/nem2p/README.md). Here is a Markdown [reference](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) for formatting your page.

    ```

    ```
    
6. Add your file(s), commit them, and push them back to your fork in GitHub.
7. From your fork in the GitHub website, submit a Pull Request for your additions to be incorporated back into the original repository. You can submit a PR by clicking on the "Contribute" drop-down and selecting "Open Pull Request". That will open up a form which you will submit.
8. Wait for a notification email that your Pull Request has been accepted.
9. Finally, in Canvas submit the GitHub URL to the page you contributed to the main repository. (i.e. submit something like https://github.com/UVADS/DS2022/blob/main/people/nem2p/README.md)
